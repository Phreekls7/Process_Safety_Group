skinparam componentStyle rectangle

component "Safety devices\nE-stops, guard switches" as Inp
component "Safety PLC / safety relays" as Safety

component "Robot controller\nsafe inputs" as RobotSafe
component "Turntable drive\nSTO input" as TurnSTO
component "Conveyor + lift drives\nSTO input" as BoxSTO
component "Main PLC\n(process control)" as PLC
component "HMI" as HMI

Inp --> Safety : safe signals

Safety --> RobotSafe : safe stop / enable\nsafe speed
Safety --> TurnSTO : STO
Safety --> BoxSTO : STO
Safety --> PLC : safety status\nreset required

PLC --> HMI : safety alarm\ninstructions
HMI --> PLC : operator reset request
PLC --> Safety : reset command\n(if conditions met)
